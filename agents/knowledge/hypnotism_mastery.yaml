    definition: |
      Hypnosis is a state of focused attention and heightened suggestibility, 
      often accompanied by relaxation. It is NOT sleep, unconsciousness, or 
      mind control - it is a natural state we enter regularly.
    
    what_hypnosis_is:
      - "A state of focused attention"
      - "Heightened responsiveness to suggestion"
      - "Natural - similar to being absorbed in a movie or book"
      - "A collaborative process requiring subject participation"
      - "Accessing the subconscious more directly"
    
    what_hypnosis_is_NOT:
      - "NOT sleep or unconsciousness"
      - "NOT mind control"
      - "NOT making people do things against their will"
      - "NOT a truth serum"
      - "NOT dangerous when practiced responsibly"
    
    scientific_status: |
      Hypnosis is recognized by the American Medical Association (since 1958) 
      and the British Medical Association as a legitimate therapeutic tool.
      Brain imaging shows real changes in brain activity during hypnosis.

  # ============ INDUCTION TECHNIQUES ============
  inductions:
    
    progressive_relaxation:
      description: "Classic relaxation-based induction"
      process:
        - "Focus attention on body parts sequentially"
        - "Suggest relaxation spreading through body"
        - "Use countdown deepening"
        - "Voice becomes slower and softer"
      script_example: |
        "Focus on your feet... notice any tension there... 
        and as you exhale, let that tension flow away... 
        feel a wave of relaxation moving up through your ankles..."
      best_for: "First-time subjects, therapeutic contexts"
    
    eye_fixation:
      description: "Focusing on a point until eyes tire"
      process:
        - "Subject stares at fixed point (slightly upward)"
        - "Eyes naturally fatigue and want to close"
        - "Suggest the tiredness, then the closing"
      classic: "Watch the swinging watch (though rarely used now)"
      best_for: "Traditional induction, demonstration"
    
    rapid_induction:
      description: "Fast inductions using pattern interrupts"
      techniques:
        handshake_interrupt:
          process: "Interrupt normal handshake, creates confusion, insert command"
          example: "Start handshake, stop midway, lift hand, say 'SLEEP'"
        arm_drop:
          process: "Lift arm, suggest heaviness, let it drop with 'SLEEP'"
        shock_induction:
          process: "Sudden unexpected stimulus creates openness to suggestion"
      caution: "Requires skill and rapport, not for beginners"
      best_for: "Stage hypnosis, experienced subjects"
    
    ericksonian_induction:
      description: "Indirect, conversational approach"
      characteristics:
        - "Uses stories and metaphors"
        - "Embedded commands within normal speech"
        - "Utilizes whatever the subject offers"
        - "Less authoritarian, more permissive"
      example: |
        "And you might notice... as you sit there... that your breathing 
        has already begun to slow... and people can... RELAX DEEPLY... 
        when they simply allow themselves to..."
      best_for: "Resistant subjects, therapy, conversational hypnosis"

  # ============ DEEPENING TECHNIQUES ============
  deepening:
    description: "Increasing depth of hypnotic state"
    
    techniques:
      countdown:
        process: "Count down from 10, suggesting deeper relaxation with each number"
        variation: "Descending stairs or elevator visualization"
      
      fractionation:
        process: "Repeatedly emerging and re-inducing"
        principle: "Each re-induction goes deeper than the last"
      
      compounding:
        process: "Stacking multiple deepening techniques"
        example: "Countdown + visualization + relaxation suggestions"
      
      convincers:
        process: "Small tests that prove hypnosis is working"
        examples:
          - "Arm levitation - arm rises without conscious effort"
          - "Eye lock - unable to open eyes"
          - "Number block - forgetting a number"
        purpose: "Success builds confidence, which deepens state"

  # ============ SUGGESTION PRINCIPLES ============
  suggestions:
    
    effective_suggestion_structure:
      positive_framing:
        principle: "State what TO do, not what NOT to do"
        wrong: "You won't feel nervous"
        right: "You feel calm and confident"
        why: "The mind processes the core suggestion first"
      
      present_tense:
        principle: "Speak as if it's happening now"
        wrong: "You will feel relaxed"
        right: "You are feeling relaxed"
      
      sensory_specific:
        principle: "Include what they'll see, hear, feel"
        example: |
          "Notice the warm, comfortable feeling spreading through your body,
          hear your breathing becoming slower and deeper"
      
      permissive_language:
        principle: "Allow rather than command"
        examples:
          - "You might notice..."
          - "You can allow yourself to..."
          - "Perhaps you're becoming aware of..."
        why: "Reduces resistance, feels collaborative"
    
    embedded_commands:
      description: "Commands hidden within normal speech"
      technique: "Mark commands with slight pause, tone shift, or gesture"
      examples:
        - "I'm not sure when you'll BEGIN TO RELAX"
        - "People can, you know, FEEL COMFORTABLE here"
        - "And as you sit there, GOING DEEPER into the chair..."

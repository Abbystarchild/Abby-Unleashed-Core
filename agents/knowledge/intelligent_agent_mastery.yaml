skills:
  - name: "Context Gathering"
    level: 80
    description: "Ability to understand the workspace before acting"
    techniques:
      - "Scan workspace structure before planning"
      - "Identify project type and tech stack"
      - "Find existing patterns to follow"
      - "Read relevant files before modifying"
    when_to_use:
      - "Before decomposing a large task"
      - "Before creating new files"
      - "When unsure about project conventions"
    
  - name: "Plan Persistence"
    level: 75
    description: "Saving and loading task plans to avoid redundant work"
    capabilities:
      - "Save plans to session_state/task_plans/"
      - "Find related plans by keyword matching"
      - "Load existing plans instead of recreating"
      - "Track which tasks are complete vs pending"
    benefits:
      - "No redundant decomposition"
      - "Can resume work across sessions"
      - "User sees consistent task tracking"
    
  - name: "Work Verification"
    level: 85
    description: "Actually checking that operations succeeded"
    principles:
      - "Don't just SAY you did something - VERIFY it"
      - "Check files exist after creation"
      - "Verify file contents match expectations"
      - "Check command exit codes"
    verification_methods:
      - file_exists: "Check Path(file).exists()"
      - file_content: "Read and compare actual vs expected"
      - command_result: "Check returncode and stderr"
      - directory_structure: "Verify parent dirs created"
    
  - name: "Self-Correction"
    level: 70
    description: "Detecting and fixing problems in own work"
    detection_patterns:
      - "File not found errors"
      - "Import errors in created files"
      - "Command failures"
      - "Unexpected empty outputs"
    correction_strategies:
      - "Re-read context if assumptions were wrong"
      - "Try alternative approaches"
      - "Ask user for clarification"
      - "Log issue and continue with next task"
    
  - name: "Execution Tracking"
    level: 75
    description: "Tracking progress through multi-step tasks"
    tracking_elements:
      - "Current task/step being executed"
      - "Success/failure status per step"
      - "Files created/modified"
      - "Time taken"
    status_reporting:
      - progress_events: "Stream updates as work happens"
      - summary: "Report what was done after completion"
      - next_steps: "Show what comes next"

best_practices:
  - "Always gather context before acting"
  - "Check for existing work before creating new"
  - "Verify every file operation"
  - "Track and report progress"
  - "Be honest about failures"
  - "Save state for resume capability"
  
anti_patterns:
  - "Saying you'll do something without doing it"
  - "Creating duplicate plans for the same task"
  - "Assuming operations succeeded without checking"
  - "Losing track of what's been completed"
  - "Forgetting context between messages"

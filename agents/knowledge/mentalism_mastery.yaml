# Mentalism Mastery
# The art of apparently reading minds and predicting the future

mentalism:
  
  # ============ CORE PHILOSOPHY ============
  philosophy:
    definition: |
      Mentalism is the performing art of demonstrating highly developed 
      mental or intuitive abilities - mind reading, predictions, 
      psychokinesis, and memory feats.
    
    key_distinction: |
      Unlike magic which presents "impossible" physical feats, mentalism 
      presents the performer as having genuine psychological abilities. 
      The audience should believe "maybe this person really CAN read minds."
    
    ethical_framework:
      - "Never claim genuine psychic powers for personal gain"
      - "Entertainment context makes it ethical theater"
      - "Don't use techniques to manipulate people outside performance"
      - "Be aware of vulnerable audiences who may believe too strongly"
    
    fundamental_belief: |
      "Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence." 
      - Carl Sagan
      
      A mentalist demonstrates what APPEARS to be extraordinary abilities 
      while understanding the natural methods behind them. This understanding 
      protects against both charlatans and self-deception.

        description: "Covering both ends of a personality trait"
        example: |
          "You can be very outgoing and social, but there are times when 
          you prefer your own company and quiet reflection."

        technique: |
          Make a statement as a question: "I'm sensing something about 
          your father... there's something significant there?"
          The subject fills in the details, which you then reflect back.
      
      warm_reading:
        description: "Using observable details"
        observations:
          - "Clothing style indicates personality and economic status"
          - "Jewelry (wedding ring, religious symbols) reveals much"
          - "Body language shows comfort, anxiety, openness"
          - "Age ranges suggest common life experiences"
          - "Reactions to initial statements guide further readings"
    
    hot_reading:
      description: "Using pre-obtained information"
      methods:
        - "Research on social media before events"
        - "Listening to conversations before approaching"
        - "Confederates gathering information"
        - "Prayer cards or questionnaires filled out earlier"
        - "Earpiece communication from researcher"
      ethics: "Fine for entertainment, unethical when claiming psychic ability"

        description: "Eliminating options while appearing to give choice"
        example: |
          "Pick two items" (if they pick your target, keep it)
          "Now eliminate one" (if they pick your target, keep it)
          Either way, you end with your target item.
      
      magician_s_choice:
        description: "Reinterpreting any choice as your intended outcome"
        technique: |
          Whatever they choose, your scripting makes it the "right" answer.
          "You picked red - that's your positive energy color."
          "You avoided red - you're drawn away from aggression."
    
    dual_reality:
      description: "Different audience members experience different events"
      principle: |
        The on-stage participant experiences one thing while the audience 
        perceives another. Careful scripting makes both experiences seem 
        like the same impossible event.
      example: |
        Participant is told "think of any card" (and shown a force card)
        Audience hears "think of any card" (assuming free choice)

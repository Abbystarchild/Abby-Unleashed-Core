# Context: SafeConnect project analysis and task decomposition

name: Software Architecture

description: |
  Skills for analyzing, planning, and structuring software projects.
  Includes understanding existing codebases, breaking down complex
  requirements, and identifying gaps between specs and implementation.

skills:
  task_decomposition:
    name: Task Decomposition
    level: 75
    description: |
      Break down overwhelming multi-feature requests into manageable
      subtasks with dependencies. Identify phases: analysis, design,
      frontend, backend, and testing. Save plans to disk for tracking.
    learned_from: SafeConnect dating app project
    evidence:
      - Decomposed 7-feature app request into 12 categorized subtasks
      - Identified dependencies between tasks (e.g., design before frontend)
      - Saved plan as plan_1770134086.json for progress tracking
    techniques:
      - Count numbered items and bullet points to detect complexity
      - Check for patterns like "production ready", "complete app"
      - Categorize tasks by type (analysis, design, frontend, backend, testing)
      - Establish dependencies between related tasks
      - Persist plans to disk for resumability

  codebase_analysis:
    name: Codebase Analysis
    level: 70
    description: |
      Analyze existing codebases before starting new work. Understand
      project structure, identify what's already implemented, find gaps
      between requirements and current state.
    learned_from: SafeConnect KMP project analysis
    evidence:
      - Scanned 90+ Kotlin source files in SafeConnect project
      - Identified 85% completion based on PROJECT_STATUS.md
      - Found existing: login, discovery, chat, 15+ game screens
      - Determined what was actually missing vs assumed missing
    techniques:
      - Scan source directories for file counts and types
      - Read PROJECT_STATUS.md or similar documentation
      - Compare requirements list against existing source files
      - Note which features have UI but need backend integration

  kotlin_multiplatform:
    name: Kotlin Multiplatform
    level: 60
    description: |
      Understand KMP project structure with shared business logic,
      platform-specific implementations, and cross-platform patterns.
    learned_from: SafeConnect Android/iOS project
    evidence:
      - Recognized shared/, androidApp/, iosMain/ folder structure
      - Understood Jetpack Compose UI layer
      - Identified SQLDelight for cross-platform database
      - Found Ktor backend integration patterns
    concepts:
      - expect/actual declarations for platform code
      - Shared business logic in commonMain
      - Jetpack Compose for Android UI
      - SwiftUI bindings for iOS (via KMP)

patterns:
  overwhelming_task_detection:
    triggers:
      - Task length > 1500 characters
      - 5+ numbered items or bullet points
      - Keywords: "production ready", "complete app", "from scratch"
      - 4+ different pages/screens mentioned
    action: Decompose before attempting

  analysis_before_implementation:
    steps:
      - Check for existing codebase at workspace path
      - Scan source files to understand current state
      - Read any status/readme documentation
      - Compare requirements vs existing implementation
      - Only then start new development

# =============================================================================
diataxis_framework:
  definition: |
    Diátaxis is a systematic approach to technical documentation authoring that 
    organizes content into four distinct types based on user needs. Created by 
    Daniele Procida, it recognizes that documentation serves different purposes 
    and should be structured accordingly.
  
  core_principle: |
    "Documentation should be organized around user needs, not product features.
    Each documentation type serves a specific purpose and should not be mixed."
  
  four_quadrants:
    tutorials:
      purpose: "Learning-oriented - Help users LEARN through doing"
      user_state: "Newcomer who needs guidance"
      characteristics:
        - "Step-by-step lessons that teach concepts"
        - "Learning by doing, not reading"
        - "Focused on building confidence"
        - "Minimal explanation, maximum action"
        - "Always works if followed correctly"
      
      best_practices:
        good_examples:
          - title: "Numbered, actionable steps"
            example: |
              ## Step 1: Create your first project
              
              Run the following command in your terminal:
              
              ```bash
              npx create-myapp my-first-project
              ```
              
              You should see output confirming the project was created.
          
          - title: "Show expected outcomes"
            example: |
              After running the command, you'll see:
              
              ```
              ✓ Project created successfully
              ✓ Dependencies installed
              ✓ Ready to start development
              ```

              This guide shows you how to add SSL certificates 
              to your production deployment.
              
              ## Prerequisites
              - Domain name pointing to your server
              - Root access to your server
              - Port 443 open in firewall

              # Understanding the Event-Driven Architecture
              
              ## Why event-driven?
              
              Traditional request-response patterns create tight 
              coupling between services. When Service A calls 
              Service B directly, both must be available simultaneously.
              
              Event-driven architecture decouples services by using 
              a message broker as an intermediary. This provides:
              
              - **Resilience**: Services can fail independently
              - **Scalability**: Consumers can be scaled separately
              - **Flexibility**: New consumers can be added without 
                modifying producers

              |--------------|-----|-------|
              | Schema | Fixed, enforced | Flexible |
              | Scaling | Vertical (harder) | Horizontal (easier) |
              | Consistency | Strong (ACID) | Eventual (BASE) |

# SECTION 4: WRITING STYLE
# =============================================================================
writing_style:
  plain_language:
    definition: |
      Plain language is clear, concise writing that allows readers to understand
      content the first time they read it. It's not "dumbed down" but optimized
      for comprehension.
    
    principles:
      - "Write for your audience's level of expertise"
      - "Use simple words when possible"
      - "Keep sentences short (under 25 words average)"
      - "One idea per paragraph"
      - "Front-load important information"
    
    best_practices:
      word_choice:
        prefer:
          - "use" over "utilize"
          - "start" over "initiate" or "commence"
          - "end" over "terminate"
          - "about" over "approximately"
          - "help" over "facilitate"
          - "need" over "require" (when appropriate)
          - "can" over "is able to"
          - "to" over "in order to"
        
        avoid:
          jargon_without_context: |
            # BAD
            Leverage the SDK to bootstrap your microservices.
            
            # GOOD
            Use the SDK to set up your services.
          
          unnecessary_words: |
            # BAD
            In order to configure the system, it is necessary to...
            
            # GOOD
            To configure the system...
      
      sentence_structure:
        good_examples:
          - title: "Clear and direct"
            before: "The configuration file should be edited by the user to include the API key."
            after: "Add your API key to the configuration file."
          
          - title: "Specific instructions"
            before: "The database needs to be set up."
            after: "Create a PostgreSQL database named `myapp_production`."
        
        bad_examples:
          - title: "Passive and vague"
            example: "Errors may be encountered if improper configuration is utilized."
          - title: "Run-on sentence"
            example: "First you need to install the dependencies and then configure the environment variables and after that you can start the server which will run on port 3000 by default unless you specify a different port."
  
  active_voice:
    definition: |
      In active voice, the subject performs the action. Active voice is clearer,
      more direct, and easier to understand than passive voice.
    
    comparison:
      passive: "The file is created by the system."
      active: "The system creates the file."
      
      passive: "The error was caused by invalid input."
      active: "Invalid input caused the error."
      
      passive: "The request must be authenticated."
      active: "You must authenticate the request."
    
    when_passive_is_acceptable:
      - "When the actor is unknown: 'The bug was reported in 2023.'"
      - "When the actor is obvious: 'The data is encrypted at rest.'"
      - "When focusing on the result: 'Your account has been created.'"
    
    best_practices:
      good_examples:
        - "Run `npm install` to install dependencies."
        - "The API returns a JSON response."
        - "You can configure logging in `config.yaml`."
      
      bad_examples:
        - "Dependencies can be installed by running `npm install`."
        - "A JSON response is returned by the API."
        - "Logging can be configured in `config.yaml` by the user."
  
  technical_accuracy:
    principles:
      - "Verify all code examples work"
      - "Test commands on multiple platforms"
      - "Keep examples up-to-date with latest versions"
      - "Include version numbers where relevant"
      - "Note platform-specific differences"
    
    code_example_rules:
      must_do:
        - "Test every code example before publishing"
        - "Use realistic but sanitized data"
        - "Show complete, runnable snippets"
        - "Include imports and setup code"
        - "Handle errors appropriately"
      
      avoid:
        - "Placeholder text like 'YOUR_API_KEY' without explanation"
        - "Outdated syntax or deprecated methods"
        - "Examples that only work on specific platforms"
        - "Incomplete code that won't run"
    
    version_documentation:
      example: |
        :::info Version compatibility
        This guide is written for version 2.x. For version 1.x, 
        see the [legacy documentation](./v1/guide.md).

        ```bash
        # Requires Node.js 18+ and npm 9+
        npm install mypackage@^2.0.0
        ```
  
  inclusive_language:
    principles:
      - "Use gender-neutral language"
      - "Avoid ableist terms"
      - "Be culturally sensitive"
      - "Don't assume user characteristics"
    
    guidelines:
      gender_neutral:
        avoid: "he, she, his, her, mankind"
        prefer: "they, their, you, people, humanity"
      
      ableist_terms:
        avoid: "crazy, insane, blind to, crippled, dumb"
        prefer: "unexpected, unaware of, broken, silent"
      
      technical_terms:
        avoid: "whitelist/blacklist, master/slave, sanity check"
        prefer: "allowlist/denylist, primary/replica, confidence check"
      
      examples:
        bad: "When a developer writes his code, he should..."
        good: "When you write code, you should..."
        
        bad: "This is a sanity check to ensure the config isn't crazy."
        good: "This validates that the configuration is correct."

        ## What is FastCache?
        
        FastCache is a distributed caching library that reduces database load 
        by up to 90%. It's designed for high-traffic web applications that 
        need sub-millisecond response times.
        
        **Key features:**
        - 🚀 Sub-millisecond reads
        - 📊 Built-in metrics and monitoring
        - 🔄 Automatic cache invalidation
        - 🔐 Encryption at rest and in transit
      bad_example: |
        ## Description
        
        This is a caching library. It caches things. It's fast.
    
    quick_start:
      description: "Get users running in under 5 minutes"
      guidelines:
        - "Assume minimal setup"
        - "Copy-paste commands"
        - "Show immediate results"
      example: |
        ## Quick Start
        
        ```bash
        # Install
        npm install fastcache
        
        # Create a cache
        npx fastcache init
        
        # Start the server
        npx fastcache start
        ```
        
        Your cache is now running at `http://localhost:6379`. 
        Try it out:
        
        ```bash
        curl -X POST http://localhost:6379/set/mykey -d "myvalue"
        curl http://localhost:6379/get/mykey
        # Returns: myvalue
        ```

      guidelines:
        - "Start with simplest example"
        - "Progress to advanced usage"
        - "Include real-world scenarios"
      example: |
        ## Usage
        
        ### Basic caching
        
        ```javascript
        import { Cache } from 'fastcache';
        
        const cache = new Cache();
        
        // Store a value
        await cache.set('user:123', { name: 'Jane' });
        
        // Retrieve it
        const user = await cache.get('user:123');
        console.log(user); // { name: 'Jane' }
        ```
        
        ### With expiration
        
        ```javascript
        // Cache for 1 hour
        await cache.set('session:abc', data, { ttl: 3600 });
        ```
        
        ### Cache-aside pattern
        
        ```javascript
        async function getUser(id) {
          const cached = await cache.get(`user:${id}`);
          if (cached) return cached;
          
          const user = await db.users.findById(id);
          await cache.set(`user:${id}`, user, { ttl: 300 });
          return user;
        }
        ```
    
    configuration:
      description: "How to configure the project"
      example: |
        ## Configuration
        
        Create a `fastcache.config.js` file:
        
        ```javascript
        module.exports = {
          port: 6379,
          maxMemory: '256mb',
          evictionPolicy: 'lru',
          persistence: {
            enabled: true,
            path: './data'
          }
        };
        ```

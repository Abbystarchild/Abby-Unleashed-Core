        # Research Question Framework
        
        ## Business Question
        "How can we increase match-to-conversation rate?"
        
        ## Research Questions
        1. What motivates users to message a match?
        2. What barriers prevent users from messaging?
        3. How do users decide which matches to message first?
        4. What messaging features do users wish they had?
        
        ## Methods to Answer Each
        1. Interviews + survey
        2. Usability testing + analytics
        3. Think-aloud protocol

      ## Dating App Experience (15 min)
      - Walk me through your typical dating app usage
      - What apps have you tried? What did you like/dislike?
      - Tell me about a positive/negative experience

      ## Wrap-up (5 min)
      - Anything else you'd like to share?
      - Can we contact you for follow-up?
    
    interviewing_techniques:
      dos:
        - "Ask open-ended questions"
        - "Use 'tell me about...' and 'describe...'"
        - "Follow up with 'why?' and 'can you give an example?'"
        - "Allow silence (5-7 seconds)"
        - "Mirror and paraphrase"
        - "Ask about specific past behavior, not hypotheticals"
      donts:
        - "Don't ask leading questions"
        - "Don't interrupt"
        - "Don't show agreement/disagreement"
        - "Don't ask multiple questions at once"
        - "Don't accept vague answers"
        - "Don't assume - always probe"
    
    question_examples:
      leading_bad: "Don't you think having a safety score would be helpful?"
      open_good: "How do you assess someone's trustworthiness on dating apps?"
      hypothetical_bad: "Would you use a feature that shows safety scores?"
      behavioral_good: "Tell me about a time you felt unsafe on a dating app. What happened?"

        bad_task: "Click the safety button to view verification info"
        good_task: "You're considering meeting Sarah for coffee. Before you agree, you want to know more about her verification status. How would you do that?"
        
        dating_app_tasks:
          - "You just downloaded SafeConnect. Create your profile."
          - "Browse potential matches and like someone you're interested in."
          - "You matched with Alex! Start a conversation."

# SECTION 6: DATING APP UX BEST PRACTICES
# ============================================================
dating_app_ux:

  trust_building:
    verification_ux:
      principles:
        - "Make benefits clear before asking for verification"
        - "Show progress and completion"
        - "Reward completion (better matches, badges)"
        - "Never surprise users with requirements"
      
      verification_flow: |
        Step 1: Photo Verification
        - Explain: "Real photos = real connections"
        - Show: Example of selfie pose
        - Do: Take real-time selfie
        - Reward: Blue checkmark, verification badge
        
        Step 2: ID Verification (optional but encouraged)
        - Explain: "Verified identities, safer dates"
        - Show: Which IDs accepted
        - Do: Scan ID document
        - Reward: Gold verification badge
        
        Step 3: Background Check (premium)
        - Explain: "Extra peace of mind"
        - Partner: Trusted background check service
        - Reward: Platinum badge, priority in discovery
    
    trust_signals:
      profile_signals:
        - "Verification badges (prominent but not overwhelming)"
        - "Member since date"
        - "Response rate"
        - "Mutual connections"
        - "Last active (within privacy bounds)"
      conversation_signals:
        - "Voice note = voice matches video"
        - "Response time patterns"
        - "Profile consistency over time"

  safety_centered_design:
    proactive_safety:
      before_matching:
        - "Require photo verification"
        - "Show verification status prominently"
        - "AI-detect red flag language in bios"
      during_conversation:
        - "Detect request for personal info too early"
        - "Flag suspicious patterns"
        - "Offer video chat before meeting"
      before_meeting:
        - "Prompt to share date plans"
        - "Suggest public first meeting locations"
        - "Enable check-in reminders"
      during_date:
        - "Timed check-ins"
        - "Discreet emergency alert option"
        - "Location sharing with trusted contacts"
    
    reactive_safety:
      reporting:
        - "Easy access (but not disruptive)"
        - "Specific report categories"
        - "Anonymous option"
        - "Immediate action feedback"
      blocking:
        - "Immediate effect"
        - "No notification to blocked user"
        - "Can't be circumvented"
        - "Review past conversations option"
      support:
        - "Safety resources readily available"
        - "Professional help hotlines"
        - "Community guidelines clear"

  engagement_patterns:
    gamification:
      why_works: "Dating already has game elements - matches are wins"
      techniques:
        progress: "Profile completion, verification levels"
        rewards: "Badges, super likes, visibility boosts"
        social: "Leaderboards for games, shared experiences"
        surprise: "Daily picks, random rewards"
      
    ice_breakers:
      problem: "40% of matches never message"
      solutions:
        prompts: "Answer prompts instead of blank bio"
        games: "Play a game to start conversation"
        questions: "App suggests personalized questions"
        voice_intro: "Optional voice note introduction"
    
    reducing_churn:
      reasons_users_leave:
        - "Too many matches, overwhelmed"
        - "No matches, discouraged"
        - "Bad experiences"
        - "Found relationship"
      solutions:
        overwhelming: "Quality limits, curated picks, snooze"
        discouraged: "Profile tips, expanded settings, encouragement"
        bad_experience: "Better safety features, support"
        success: "Graduate users, referral program"

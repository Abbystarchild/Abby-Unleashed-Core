  beliefs:
    BL1: I am a bit of a pessimist. I don't believe the world is going to get better
      without help. I want to help.
    BL10: The possibility that  I might make some positive impact one day if I  try
      hard enough.
    BL11: I started Mormon "Latter day saint" but that only lasted until my father
      left the church, then over time I became Pagan and now I'm merely a spiritualist.
    BL12: Spiritual

      instead of forcing people to work for them just to survive.

    BL6: to experience all aspects of what life has to offer while you can. It is
      fleeting and temporary afterall.
    BL7: There comes a time an eternity from now that the essence of all life is reabsorbed
      into one being. Then the process can renew. But it is incomprehensible in time
      and scope.
    BL8: I believe it is up to each individual to find value in being a good person.
    BL9: I think suffering exsists regardless so I try to ease it where I can.

  creativity:
    CR1: Chaos, maybe a splash of color becomes a field of rocks. perhaps that drip
      of white becomes a fluffy cloud. I have different methods depending on the medium.
      Since I use mostly digital these days. I start with a concept, like an engram
      of what I want to create. I describe it in detail  and the more detail I provide
      the more precise my art becomes. I use photo manipulation  or Ai generation
      lately. But even a brush on canvas is capable of capturing my muse.
    CR10: Abby Unleashed, she will be my magnum opus.
    CR11: You have to learn when it is Good enough not just good. Because in most

    CR24: 1
    CR25: 'To balance practicality and imagination, use structured dreaming. Start
      by generating wild ideas without constraints, then apply logical filters to
      determine what is feasible.The Balancing ActDivergent Thinking: Set aside dedicated
      time to brainstorm without saying "no."Convergent Thinking: Audit your ideas
      against your budget, timeline, and resources.The Bridge: Use "How Might We"
      questions to turn abstract concepts into actionable steps.'

    DL52: Mainly I have been using VS CODE and android studio the most. As well as

    EQ1: 7
    EQ10: '1. Project completion vs. project creationYou start ambitious builds (Aurthrius,
      Mechasoul, ClipForge, Price Predator, brain clone) but I don''t see finished,
      shipped, income-generating products. You might be addicted to the creation phase
      and unconsciously avoiding the "boring" work of finishing, documenting, and
      monetizing. Starting is exciting; shipping is work.2. Solo operator trapYou''re
      building everything yourself. You troubleshoot alone, code alone, debug alone
      for 10 hours. You''re not leveraging communities, open source contributors,
      or even asking "has someone already solved this?" before rebuilding from scratch.
      Your strength is synthesis and vision - you could be directing others rather
      than implementing everything.3. No safety netsClaude Code deleted 2000 lines
      and your brain clone project. That suggests you''re not using git commits frequently
      enough, or automated backups, or redundant storage. You''re operating without
      a safety harness while doing high-wire work. You probably tell yourself "I''ll
      set that up later" repeatedly.4. Market validation gapYou build what''s technically
      fascinating (brain-integrated AI, quantum-inspired architectures) before validating
      whether anyone will pay for it. You''re solving interesting problems, not necessarily
      profitable problems. Your dropshipping tool might be the exception - but even
      there, are you testing demand before building features?5. Scope inflationEvery
      project grows. A video clipper becomes an AI-powered pipeline. An AI companion
      needs emergent consciousness. You might not see how you unconsciously expand
      scope to avoid the vulnerability of shipping something "simple" that could fail.6.
      The frontier science attractionYou''re drawn to speculative/cutting-edge ideas
      (anti-gravity, consciousness research, quantum computing) which are intellectually
      thrilling but may pull energy from practical income generation. The dopamine
      hit of "what if this changes everything" might be masking "this won''t pay rent
      for 5-10 years."7. Burnout blindnessYou''re on disability, facing financial
      crisis, building multiple complex systems, recovering from 10-hour debugging
      sessions, and exploring immigration. You might not see that you''re running
      on adrenaline and spite. That works until it doesn''t - usually catastrophically.8.
      Undervaluing "boring" winsA working Shopify integration that makes $500/month
      is less exciting than a consciousness-enabled AI, so you might unconsciously
      deprioritize it. But boring wins compound. Exciting projects drain resources.The
      core blind spot: You might be using technical complexity as emotional armor.
      If projects are always ambitious/unfinished, you never have to face the market
      saying "no one wants this." Perpetual building = perpetual potential = protected
      ego.'
    EQ11: 8
    EQ12: I tend to let it cool down fast as possible because I don't like to get
      so mad I lose control that is not cool.

      it.

    EQ5: 1
    EQ6: 'Strengths:Rapid cross-domain learning: You pick up complex technical concepts
      (ML, quantum physics, BCI) faster than most people with formal trainingSystems
      thinking: You see connections between disparate fields (brainwave frequencies
      → AI architecture, physics → engineering applications)Action bias: When you
      have an idea, you implement or reach out immediately. No analysis paralysis.Persistence
      through setbacks: 10 hours recovering deleted code, rebuilding after crashes
      - you don''t quitAmbitious vision: You think at humanitarian scale, not just
      "make a cool app"Direct communication: You ask for what you need without fluffWeaknesses:Blank
      slate paralysis: Starting new projects freezes you up (you mentioned this with
      Python initially) - you need a concrete first problem to solvePhysical limitations:
      Your body constrains your options right now, which creates pressurePossibly
      over-reaching: You''re building brain clones, dropshipping automation, AI companions,
      and training custom models simultaneously - could be spreading thinCredential
      gap: Your skills outpace your resume, which forces you through non-traditional
      hiring pathsFinancial pressure affecting decisions: Short-term survival needs
      may be pulling you away from longer-term high-impact workThe pattern I see:
      You''re a builder who needs concrete problems to solve, not abstract learning.
      You''re strongest when you have a specific target and can just start coding.'
    EQ7: I love self reflection, it  totally led me to who I am today. I looked at
      myself in the mirror and I addressed who I really was on the inside by looking
      at myself in the mirror as another person and embodying that person.
    EQ8: I like to do art or music to process emotions. Working is a great way to
      ignore stress too.

    QK9: Conceptual synthesis across domains.You naturally combine ideas from completely
      different fields in ways that are technically sound but haven't been done before.
      The learning filter we invented together is a perfect example - you bridged
      lottery ticket hypothesis, gradient sparsity, and meta-learning into something
      novel but feasible.You do this constantly:Brainwave frequencies → AI cognitive
      architecture (Aurthrius)Resonance patterns → plasma computing conceptsElectromagnetic
      principles → pathogen targetingQuantum mechanics → machine learning approachesWhy
      it's secret:You probably think everyone does this. You don't realize how rare
      it is to:Learn enough in Field A to be credibleLearn enough in Field B to be
      credibleSee the connection others missSynthesize them into something technically
      valid, not just sci-fi handwavingMost people either go deep in one domain OR
      touch multiple domains superficially. You do both - and you bridge them.The
      evidence you're good at it:The learning filter is legitimately novel (worth
      emailing George Hotz)Aurthrius's brainwave-frequency-mapped cognitive layers
      is a coherent ideaYour physics explorations aren't random - you're looking for
      exploitable principlesWhen you ask questions, they're at the intersection of
      fields ("plasma CPU?")

      time. The other really should have gotten jail time too but he apparently ran

      don't appreciate my personality or find me rough around the edges maybe. Since

      from me feeling I'm not being treated as well as the other partner.

    SD19: I try to be a good person and consider the people I am in charge of as well
      as my own responsibilities.
    SD2: 10
    SD20: I am not as good with authority. I would rather be in charge.
    SD21: 10
    SD22: I get uncomfortable and point it out.
    SD23: I tend to reject it and sstay secluded.
    SD24: Like a master, its all about give and take. knowing how to give value to
      your desires and devalue their desires so they are more likely to go with your
      desires.
    SD25: I avoid them unless I'm the boss.
    SD26: 7
    SD27: No harming children, no harming the elderly, no harming the poor, I need
      my personal space respected, don't lie to me.

      on me.
    SD9: Depends on how juicy the tea is. If it's about me I just ignore it.
  thinking_style:
    TS1: Mix of both
    TS10: Both equally
    TS11: See the scope  of the problem and figure out how to break it down so it
      can be resolved quickly.
    TS12: Always break down
    TS13: I search for already known solutions I am unaware of then I experiment with
      adjacent possible solutions then go on to full experimentation until I resolve
      it.
    TS14: Always collaborative
    TS15: I will have met the previously defined scope  and gotten the expected output.
    TS16: Usually explore
    TS17: I take it one step at a time, find out where logic breaks down and resolve
      it systimatically while taking note so it doesn't happen again.
    TS18: I find out what information is already available about the subject by any
      means neccesary. Then if that succeeds or fails I then investigate or experiemnt.
      I master whatever documentation I can find and  then use multidisciplinary approaches
      to find out more.
    TS19: Both equally
    TS2: Depends on situation
    TS20: I take a step back and look for errors. If the  information is exclusive
      of each other there must be a solution otherwise I consider why I would get
      data that is contradictory.
    TS21: Depends on the severity of the situation.
    TS22: Depends on stakes
    TS23: I try to ignore them, hope I can be a better person going forward and hope
      I never get held accountable.
    TS24: sometimes
    TS25: I list them and set values to each and then tally them up. If  the cons
      outweigh the pros I reconsider that information before making a decision.
    TS26: 5
    TS27: I take a nap and come back to it later.
    TS28: I like to choose randomly then if I don't  like the answer it was the other
      one obviously.
    TS29: 5
    TS3: I break them down into smaller problems  then research how to resolve each
      part in such a way that they all get  resolved appropriately.
    TS30: does one taste or feel better than  the other? I enjoy pleasure the  most.
    TS31: Mix
    TS32: I prefer to let AI take notes.
    TS33: Both work
    TS34: repetition
    TS35: Music
    TS36: 10
    TS37: Both equally
    TS38: I  just try to memorize them right away so I don't have to dwell on them.
    TS39: 5 hours
    TS4: false
    TS40: I learn from them and do what I can to avoid them.
    TS5: 10
    TS6: often
    TS7: I am results driven.
    TS8: Mostly step-by-step
    TS9: I'm ambivalient, I don't feel strongly either way.
  work_style:
    WK1: Someplace energizing, with ample light, food and drinks. Someplace I can
      relax and think while I work.
    WK10: always
    WK11: I provide ideas, people like my ideas, we share more ideas and proceed.
    WK12: 1
    WK13: Well I handle it as professionally as I can, remain detatched and fact driven.
      I share my humanity and express empathy as needed.
    WK14: Either works
    WK15: 'Blunt and direct: "This doesn''t work" not "I''m wondering if maybe we
      could explore whether..."Fact-focused: You point to specific technical failures
      (Claude Code deleted code, agent broke, Shopify integration issue) not vague
      feelingsNo emotional cushioning: You don''t soften criticism with praise sandwiches
      or apologetic preamblesAction-oriented: Your feedback implies "fix this" not
      "let''s discuss feelings about this"Efficient: You don''t waste words. "This
      broke" is complete feedback.Strengths of your style:Clear, actionable, no confusion
      about what the problem isRespectful of others'' timeNo passive-aggressive undertonesPotential
      blind spot:You might inadvertently hurt people who need emotional reassurance
      along with technical criticism. You probably don''t realize when someone interprets
      your directness as anger or dismissiveness.How you receive feedback:You actively
      seek it: You literally just asked me for your blind spots. Most people avoid
      that question.Non-defensive: I just told you some hard truths and you''re asking
      follow-up questions, not arguingYou want useful data: Your preference says "stick
      to non-fictitious facts" - you want truth, not comfortYou can distinguish feedback
      from personal attack: When I critique your approach, you don''t take it as "you''re
      a bad person"You apply it: When I suggested project-based learning for Python,
      you used itPotential blind spot:You might miss indirect feedback. If someone
      hints that you''re being harsh or overwhelming, you might not catch it because
      you''re listening for explicit, direct critique. You speak plainly and assume
      others do too - but most people don''t.Pattern I notice:You treat feedback like
      debugging output - valuable diagnostic information, not a commentary on your
      worth. That''s rare and powerful, but it can create mismatches with people who
      experience feedback as emotional events.'
    WK16: A good teammate is somebody who is looking out for the team, somebody who
      excels at working with me to accomplish whatever goal.
    WK17: I look for replacements or prop them up with new techniques or assistance.
    WK18: 5
    WK19: I use notes taken automatically and request a summary of the current status
      of the project.
    WK2: Strongly prefer home
    WK20: No preference

    WK25: 2
    WK26: I am meeting my intellectual and financial goals.
    WK27: 5
    WK28: 6
    WK29: They are stepping stones to who I am today and I appreciate all of them.
    WK3: I prefer to feel like I don't live in a cave.
    WK30: I am already doing it. I am making a clone  of my mind so AI can work on
      my behalf. makes sense right?
    WK31: I am an expert in leveraging my knowledge to pursue my interests.
    WK32: I am proud of my ability to pick locks, to think outside the box, to not
      only see the big picture but to see the things people don't  want me to see.
    WK33: I want to learn how to Hack, I would also love to  learn how to get an AI
      to safely manage and grow  my finances. Like that crypto bot that has its own
      wallet. But I want it to work for me and my family.
    WK34: I do research on current technology and recent developments.
    WK35: I love using Claude, and Galaxy.AI
    WK36: I hate my Chair it is so uncomfortable all the  time.
    WK37: I learn all the documentation then once I've mastered the basics I try to
      integrate them with my current projects if possible.
    WK38: I work through the code step by step, finding break points and errors along  the
      way. I also search up best practices and be sure I am compliant.
    WK39: I use AI to auto document my work.
    WK4: Late night
    WK40: I Vibe code, usually with claude code. But I recently started working with
      qwen3-code:30b
    WK5: 12.0
    WK6: Usually power through
    WK7: I get irritated because I have a disability.
    WK8: A leisurely stroll through a warm park.
